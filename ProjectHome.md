Development of the `gclient` script (which manages checkouts and updates for a set of client modules in various SCM repository locations) has been superseded by [depot\_tools](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools) in the Chromium project repository.

To work with the latest version of gclient, `svn checkout` http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools.
